## 13. Real Data Importance

### 13.1 Why Accurate Data is Critical for Nurses

Your documentation directly impacts patient safety. HMS Core requires real data because:

**Patient Safety**
| Data | Impact |
|------|--------|
| Vital Signs | Detect deterioration early |
| Medication Records | Prevent double-dosing or missed doses |
| Intake/Output | Prevent fluid overload or dehydration |
| Allergies | Prevent adverse reactions |
| Fall Risk | Prevent patient falls |

**Clinical Decisions**
- Doctors base treatment on YOUR documentation
- AI systems detect patterns from YOUR data
- Other nurses rely on YOUR handover notes

**Legal Protection**
- Your documentation is legal evidence
- "If it wasn't documented, it wasn't done"
- Protects you and the hospital

**NABH Compliance**
- Accreditation requires accurate records
- Auditors review nursing documentation
- Quality metrics derived from data

### 13.2 Data Entry Standards

| Standard | Practice |
|----------|----------|
| Timeliness | Document immediately after action |
| Accuracy | Double-check values before saving |
| Completeness | Fill all required fields |
| Signature | Always sign your entries |
| Objectivity | Document facts, not opinions |

### 13.3 Common Documentation Errors to Avoid

| Error | Correct Practice |
|-------|------------------|
| Pre-signing MAR | Sign AFTER giving medication |
| Estimating vitals | Measure and record actual values |
| Delayed documentation | Document within 15 minutes |
| Copying values | Measure each patient individually |
| Missing signatures | Always sign every entry |

### 13.4 Your Data Quality Responsibilities

1. Record vitals at scheduled times
2. Document medications immediately after giving
3. Complete all required fields
4. Sign every entry
5. Report data discrepancies
6. Never falsify records
