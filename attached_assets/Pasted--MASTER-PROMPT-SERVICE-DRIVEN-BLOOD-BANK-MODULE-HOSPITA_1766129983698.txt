IPD, ICU, NICU, PICU patients

Emergency & Trauma cases

OT & surgical blood support

Inter-department blood requests

Donor management & traceability


3️⃣ CORE PRINCIPLE – SERVICE-DRIVEN DESIGN
Every blood activity must be executed as a SERVICE.
🚫 No direct status change
 🚫 No manual shortcuts
✅ Only approved services can move blood from one stage to another

5️⃣ BLOOD UNIT MASTER (SERVICE-LINKED)
Each blood unit must have:
Mandatory Fields:
Blood Unit ID (Barcode / QR)

Component Type

Blood Group & Rh

Donor ID

Collection Service ID

Testing Service IDs

Storage Service ID

7️⃣ SERVICE-ENFORCED WORKFLOW (CRITICAL)
Blood lifecycle must strictly follow:
Donor → Collection → Testing → Storage → Issue → Transfusion / Return / Disposal
System must BLOCK:
Blood issue without testing service

Blood issue without compatibility service

Blood issue after expiry

Blood issue from quarantine


8️⃣ STORAGE & TEMPERATURE CONTROL
Implement:
Storage Unit Master (Fridge / Freezer)

Temperature range definition

Continuous temperature logs

Breach alerts

Auto-quarantine on breach

Temperature logs must be non-editable.

9️⃣ TRANSFUSION SAFETY RULES
System must ensure:
Doctor order mandatory

Patient-blood compatibility enforced

Reaction monitoring enabled

Emergency override logged separately


🔟 DATA VALIDATION RULES
The system must prevent:

Inspection-ready reports


1️⃣3️⃣ ERROR HANDLING & ALERTS
System must alert:
Expiry approaching

Temperature breach

Emergency stock shortage

Reaction events

Compliance violations


1️⃣4️⃣ FINAL EXPECTATION
The Blood Bank Module must function as:
