✅ 🔥 COMPLETE DEVELOPMENT PROMPT FOR BIO-MEDICAL WASTE MANAGEMENT MODULE

TITLE: “Integrate a fully NABH & CPCB-compliant Biomedical Waste Management Module into the Hospital App.”

1️⃣ OBJECTIVE

Build a fully digital, end-to-end Biowaste Tracking System inside the hospital app that:

Tracks waste from generation → segregation → storage → pickup → disposal

Supports color-coded BMW categories

Uses barcode-based tracking as per CPCB BMW Rules

Generates daily, monthly, and annual reports

Ensures NABH compliance

This module will be used by doctors, nurses, housekeeping, hospital admin, and CBWTF vendor.

2️⃣ CORE FEATURES TO DEVELOP
A. Waste Generation & Barcode System

Create a "Generate Waste Bag" button.

User selects:

Department (OPD/ICU/OT/Lab/Ward)

Waste Category (Yellow/Red/White/Blue)

Approx weight

System generates:

Unique BMW Bag ID

Auto barcode

Printable barcode sticker

B. Internal Waste Collection Tracking

Staff scans bags with mobile camera/scanner.

System validates the waste category.

Logs:

Bag ID

Weight after collection

Timestamp

Staff name & role

Current location (Ward → Temporary Store)

C. Temporary Storage Room Management

Dashboard showing:

Bags currently in storage

Category-wise weight summary

Bags waiting for CBWTF pickup

48-hour storage limit alerts

Storage temperature/cleaning logs (optional)

D. Vendor Pickup Module (CBWTF)

Vendor logs in and performs:

Scan each bag

Confirm pickup

Enter final weight

Upload pickup slip

Upload disposal evidence (after treatment)

System generates:

Digital Pickup Receipt (DPR)

Auto-sync to CPCB format (if API enabled)

E. Disposal Tracking

Vendor or hospital admin updates:

Treatment method (autoclave/incineration/etc.)

Treatment date/time

Certificate upload

Final disposal status

4️⃣ DATABASE STRUCTURE (IMPORTANT)

Create these tables:

Table: bmw_bags
Field	Type	Description
id	UUID	Unique bag ID
barcode	String	Auto-generated
category	Enum(Yellow, Red, White, Blue)	Waste type
department	String	Location generated
approx_weight	Float	From nurse
final_weight	Float	From handler
status	Enum(Generated, Collected, Stored, PickedUp, Disposed)	
created_at	Timestamp	When generated
updated_at	Timestamp	Last update
Table: bmw_movements

Tracks all steps of bag:

| bag_id | action | by_user | timestamp | location |

Table: bmw_pickups

| pickup_id | vendor_id | date | total_weight | slip_url |

Table: bmw_disposal

| bag_id | method | disposal_date | certificate_file |

5️⃣ WORKFLOW TO IMPLEMENT (END TO END)
