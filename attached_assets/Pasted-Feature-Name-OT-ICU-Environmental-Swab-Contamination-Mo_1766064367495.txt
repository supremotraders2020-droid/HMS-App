Feature Name: OT & ICU Environmental Swab Contamination Monitoring Module

🎯 OBJECTIVE

Build a NABH-compliant digital module inside our hospital application to capture, process, monitor, and audit OT & ICU swab contamination data for infection control and hospital-acquired infection (HAI) prevention.

The system must support end-to-end workflow:
Swab Collection → Lab Processing → Result Evaluation → Corrective Action (CAPA) → Audit Reports.

🏥 MODULE LOCATION IN APP

Hospital App → Infection Control → Environmental Surveillance → OT & ICU Swabs

1️⃣ USER ROLES & PERMISSIONS

Define role-based access:

Infection Control Nurse (ICN)

Create swab entries

View results

Initiate CAPA

Microbiology Lab Staff

Enter culture results

Upload reports

Housekeeping Supervisor

View failed cases

Update cleaning / fumigation actions

Admin / Medical Superintendent

View dashboards

Close CAPA

Export NABH reports

All actions must be timestamped and audit-logged.

2️⃣ MASTER DATA SETUP (CONFIGURABLE)

Create admin-configurable masters:

📌 Area Master

Hospital → Block → Floor → OT / ICU → Equipment / Bed

📌 Sampling Site Master

OT Table

OT Light

Ventilator

Bed Rail

Monitor

Door Handle

Floor

Air Sample

📌 Organism Master

No Growth

Skin Flora (CoNS)

E. coli

Klebsiella

Pseudomonas

MRSA

Fungus

3️⃣ SWAB COLLECTION WORKFLOW (FRONT-END)

Create a Swab Collection Form with:

Auto-generated Swab ID (QR / Barcode)

Date & Time (auto)

Area Type: OT / ICU

Area Name (dropdown from Area Master)

Sampling Site (dropdown)

Reason:

Routine

Post-fumigation

Outbreak suspicion

Collected By (Staff ID)

Remarks

Status: Pending Lab Result

On submit:

Create lab task

Lock record from editing

4️⃣ LAB RESULT ENTRY MODULE

Allow Microbiology Lab to enter:

Swab ID (scan / select)

Culture Media (Blood agar, MacConkey, etc.)

Organism Detected (dropdown)

CFU Count (numeric)

Growth Level:

None

Low

Moderate

Heavy

Sensitivity Test (Yes / No)

Result Date

5️⃣ AUTO-INTERPRETATION LOGIC (CRITICAL)

Implement system rules:

IF Organism = "No Growth"
   Status = PASS

IF Organism = "Skin Flora" AND CFU = Low
   Status = ACCEPTABLE

IF Organism = Pathogen OR CFU >= Moderate
   Status = FAIL


On FAIL:

Auto-generate CAPA ticket

Trigger alerts

6️⃣ CAPA (CORRECTIVE & PREVENTIVE ACTION) MODULE

For failed swabs, auto-open CAPA with:

Issue Summary (auto)

Root Cause (select)

Immediate Action:

Deep cleaning

Fumigation

Fogging

Responsible Department

Target Closure Date

Verification Swab Required (Yes / No)

Closure Status

CAPA must be mandatory before closure.
