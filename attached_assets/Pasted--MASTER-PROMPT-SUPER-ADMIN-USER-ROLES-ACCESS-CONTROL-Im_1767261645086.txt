✅ MASTER PROMPT – SUPER ADMIN (USER ROLES & ACCESS CONTROL)

Implement a Super Admin role as the highest authority in the system with complete and irreversible control over critical hospital operations, financials, and security.

Scope & Permissions

The Super Admin must have exclusive access to:

Billing Finalization (OPD & IPD)

Review, approve, and finalize bills

Lock finalized bills to prevent edits by any role

Allow controlled reopen only by Super Admin with reason logging

Stock & Pharmacy Control

Full CRUD on medicine stock, pricing, GST, expiry, batch tracking

Lock stock adjustments post audit

Approve negative stock or emergency overrides

Surgery Costing & Packages

Define surgery-wise costing (OT, surgeon, anesthesia, consumables)

Create/edit bundled surgery packages

Lock package pricing once activated

Medicinal Database Management

Add/edit/delete medicines (salt, brand, dosage, form)

Fine-grained permission matrix (view, add, edit, delete, approve)

Restrict privilege escalation

Audit Logs & Financial Locking

Log every critical action with:

User ID

Timestamp

Action type

Before/After values

IP / device info

Ensure logs are immutable and non-editable

System Rules

No role can override or bypass Super Admin decisions

All finalized financial records must be read-only

Any unlock action requires Super Admin approval + reason

Enforce role-based access checks at API and UI level

Compliance & Security

Ensure NABH / HIPAA-style compliance

Encrypt sensitive financial and insurance data

Maintain complete traceability for audits

Expected Outcome

A secure, enterprise-grade Super Admin control layer with irreversible financial locking, strict RBAC enforcement, full auditability, and zero unauthorized access.
