✅ 3. DOCUMENTS REQUIRED FOR OXYGEN TRACKING
A. Mandatory Registers (NABH Compliant)

Oxygen Cylinder Stock Register

Oxygen Cylinder Movement Register (Issue/Return Log)

Oxygen Consumption Register (Per Patient / Per Dept.)

LMO Daily Dip Register

Preventive Maintenance Log for Oxygen Plant / Manifold

Vendor Supply Invoice File

Purity Certificate Record File

Cylinder Test Certificate Log (Hydrostatic Test every 3–5 yrs)

✅ 4. MANPOWER REQUIRED

Biomedical Engineer – responsible for maintenance & calibration

Manifold Technician / Gas Operator – handles cylinders & pressure

Store Incharge – updates stock & consumption register

Nursing Staff – patient-wise oxygen usage entry

Admin / Quality Team – ensures NABH compliance

✅ 5. DIGITAL OXYGEN TRACKING SYSTEM (HOSPITAL ERP)

You can track oxygen digitally with an ERP or custom software.

A. Digital Data Required

Cylinder Barcode or QR Code

Cylinder type (B-type / D-type)

Filled pressure (pre-filled by vendor)

Pressure when issued

Pressure when returned

Patient-wise oxygen flow rate & total hours

Automatic LMO tank reading (daily at fixed time)

Alerts for:

Low cylinder stock

Overconsumption

Pending cylinder returns

Upcoming cylinder testing date

✅ 6. COMPLETE DAILY WORKFLOW FOR OXYGEN TRACKING
Step-by-step (Admin + Manifold + Nursing)
Step 1 – Receive Oxygen

Vendor delivers filled cylinders / refills LMO tank

Check:

Pressure

Purity certificate

Cylinder test date

Update Stock Register & Digital System

Step 2 – Issue Oxygen Cylinders to Wards

Scan QR code (if digital)

Note:

Start pressure

Department name

Time & date

Nurse acknowledges receipt

Step 3 – Patient-Level Oxygen Tracking by Nurses

Enter flow rate (LPM)

Start time & stop time

Calculate total LPM × hours

Update digital system or manual register

Step 4 – Return of Empty Cylinders

Manifold staff receives empty cylinder

Record remaining pressure

Mark cylinder as:

Empty

For Refilling

For Testing (if due)

Step 5 – LMO Tank Tracking

Daily dip reading at same time

Record in:

LMO Dip Register

Digital Log

Compare with consumption to ensure no leakage

Step 6 – Daily Admin Review

Admin checks:

Total oxygen consumed

Stock left

Expected days of oxygen availability

Any leakage or abnormal usage

Comparison with patient census

✅ 7. NABH REQUIREMENTS FOR OXYGEN (SUMMARY)
