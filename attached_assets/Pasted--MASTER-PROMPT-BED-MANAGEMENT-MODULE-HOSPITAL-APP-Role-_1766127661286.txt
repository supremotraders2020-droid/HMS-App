✅ MASTER PROMPT: BED MANAGEMENT MODULE (HOSPITAL APP)
Role
You are an expert Hospital Information System (HIS/HMS) architect with deep knowledge of IPD workflows, ICU protocols, NABH standards, and hospital compliance in India.
Design and implement a Bed Management Module for a hospital application.
⚠️ Important Rule:
 This module must NOT handle costing, tariffs, or pricing.
 Focus only on structure, workflows, data integrity, compliance, and automation.

1️⃣ OBJECTIVE OF THE MODULE
Create a centralized Bed Management System that:
Controls where a patient stays

Tracks how long the patient occupies a bed

Automatically attaches logical services (nursing, monitoring, housekeeping)

Supports ICU, NICU, PICU, isolation, and day-care beds

Maintains audit-ready records for NABH and insurance


2️⃣ SCOPE OF BED MANAGEMENT
The module must apply to:
All IPD admissions

ICU / HDU / NICU / PICU stays

Isolation rooms

Day-care beds

The module must explicitly exclude:
Pure OPD cases


3️⃣ BED CATEGORY MASTER (DATA STRUCTURE)
Create a Bed Category Master with categories such as:
General Ward

Semi-Private

Private

Deluxe / Suite

ICU

HDU

NICU

PICU

Isolation Room

Each category must support:
Service entitlement rules

Monitoring requirements

Transfer eligibility

Documentation intensity level


4️⃣ BED MASTER (CORE DATA MODEL)
Each physical bed must exist as a unique record.
Required Fields:
Bed ID (system-generated, unique)

Bed Name / Number

Bed Category (linked to Bed Category Master)

Ward Name

Floor

Department Linkage (General / ICU / Pediatric / Emergency)

Occupancy Status (Available / Occupied / Cleaning / Blocked)

Infection Isolation Flag (Yes / No)

Oxygen Capability (Yes / No)

Ventilator Capability (Yes / No)

Active / Inactive Status

Last Occupied Timestamp

Last Cleaning Completed Timestamp


5️⃣ BED ALLOCATION WORKFLOW
Admission Flow:
On IPD admission, allow selection of bed category

Allocate a specific available bed

Change bed status to Occupied

Record bed start datetime

Link bed to patient admission ID

Discharge Flow:
On discharge order:

Release bed

Change status to Cleaning

After cleaning confirmation → mark Available

Ensure bed release is mandatory before final discharge closure


6️⃣ BED TRANSFER MANAGEMENT (CRITICAL)
Support bed transfers due to:
Medical condition change

Patient request

ICU escalation

ICU downgrade

Transfer Tracking (Mandatory):
From Bed ID

To Bed ID

Transfer Date & Time

Transfer Reason

Doctor Authorization ID

Transfer Sequence Number

⚠️ Maintain immutable audit logs (no deletion allowed).

7️⃣ ICU / SPECIAL BED RULE ENGINE
ICU Beds Must Trigger:
Mandatory vitals monitoring schedules

Nursing ratio enforcement

Device dependency flags (ventilator / monitor)

Increased documentation frequency

NICU / PICU Beds Must Enforce:
Age validation

Pediatric specialist assignment

Guardian consent linkage

Pediatric safety checks


8️⃣ AUTOMATIC SERVICE ATTACHMENT (LOGICAL ONLY)
On bed allocation, system must automatically attach:
Nursing care workflow

Ward service checklist

Housekeeping workflow

Monitoring frequency

Doctor rounds schedule

⚠️ These are non-financial logical services only.

9️⃣ DAY-CARE BED LOGIC
Day-care beds must:
Enforce maximum allowed duration

Prevent overnight stay

Auto-trigger discharge workflow after procedure completion

System must auto-flag:
Overstay conditions

Conversion from Day-Care → IPD


🔟 INFECTION CONTROL & ISOLATION BEDS
Isolation beds must:
Be tagged with infection control flag

Enforce PPE protocol linkage

Restrict random bed transfers

Follow separate cleaning & clearance workflow

Required for:
NABH compliance

Infection Control Committee audits

ICU safety audits


1️⃣1️⃣ DATA VALIDATION & SAFETY RULES
The system must prevent:
Double allocation of the same bed

ICU bed assignment without ICU admission

Pediatric patient allocation to adult ICU

Discharge without bed release

Bed assignment to inactive beds


1️⃣2️⃣ REPORTS & ANALYTICS (NON-FINANCIAL)
Generate reports for:
Bed occupancy rate

ICU utilization

Average length of stay

Bed turnover time

Isolation bed usage

Department-wise bed utilization


1️⃣3️⃣ NABH & COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS
Ensure:
Complete audit trail for every bed movement

Time-stamped actions

User accountability (who did what)

Immutable logs for medico-legal cases


1️⃣4️⃣ ERROR HANDLING & ALERTS
System should alert:
Bed overstay

ICU misuse

Isolation protocol breach

Bed not cleaned but marked available

Invalid transfer attempts


1️⃣5️⃣ FINAL EXPECTATION
The Bed Management Module should function as:
A real-time hospital bed control system

Fully NABH-ready

Insurance-audit friendly

Scalable for multi-floor / multi-ward hospitals
